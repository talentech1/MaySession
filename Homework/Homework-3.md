# Homework 3

### Write a program for each of the following 
 1.  Given an array,  ``int[] numbers = {23, 423, 12, 598, 200, 112}; ``, find the total of all the values in the array.
 2. Declare an empty character array.
 3. Given an array,  ``int[] numbers = {23, 423, 12, 598, 200, 112};`` find if the array includes the number 200.
 4. Given an array ``int[] intArray2 = { 61, 17, 58, 39, 10 };``, find the average of all the values
 5. Given an array ``int[] intArray2 = { 61, 17, 58, 39, 10 };``, find the largest values in the array
 6. Given an array ``String[] brands = {"Verizon", "Adidas", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda","Exxon", "Google",  };`` remove any brand that has more than 5 characters.
 7. Given an array ``String[] brands = {"Verizon", "Adidas", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda","Exxon", "Google",  };`` convert all the values to UpperCase.
 8. Given an array ``String[] brands = {"Verizon", "Adidas", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda","Exxon", "Google",  };`` print the values in reverse order
 9. Given an array ``int[] intArray2 = { 61, 17, 58, 39, 10 };`` print the values in order ex. 10, 17,39....
 10. Can you change the length of an array? Explain.
